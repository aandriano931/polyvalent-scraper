# polyvalent-scraper
Polyvalent scraper to extract data, postprocess it and insert it in a mongoDB database

Next steps:

- Add a crawler for another bank
- Extend the crawling to other type of data (energy consumption?)
- Add a dispatcher to send a RabbitMQ message when data is added to the mongoDB database
- Improve logging monitoring?
- Improve project architecture/directory structure
